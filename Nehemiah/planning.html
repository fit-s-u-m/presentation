						## Dream by

						## so what is my  dream
						---
						To revolutionize the **education** 
						---
						### The core for all problems here is Bad Educational system 
						---
						### We all are students we know the education is not perfect every body is learning just because 
						with no purpose 
						---
						### when you ask students why do you **hate** this subject they say its because the wrong teacher 
						---
						### or worse I didn't learn it as a young age they **don't teach** it where i came from
						---
						### people think that education is only **maths** and **science** and its not
						---
						### why not dance , Art , music 
						even football
						---
						And we can change both with **Nehemiah**
