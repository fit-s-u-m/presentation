						#### Al-Biruni's Classic Experiment
						   how do you calculate the radius of the earth in 10th century
							Biruni solved it we unprecedented accuracy and precision at this time
							he used *Trigonometry* to calculate the radius of the earth
							but he found out that 
						---

						---
						he found that $$Radius = \frac{h\cos{\alpha}}{1-\cos{\alpha}}$$
						---
						#### navigation 
						if you want to be  pilot, in ships, planes its very usefull to know trigonometry

						#### Do you know you can convert any complex function to sum of sin and cos with different frequency
						so this means you can represent any function as the sum of *trigonometry*
						and this is called Fourier transform
						in filtering 
						in compression 
						---
						And this is very useful for music because it helps you filter a noise because it break down the signal into frequency component
						so we can filter the noise in the audio

						#### Architecture 
						in civil engineering it is very useful to analysis how much load can building(bridges) can hold
						and knowing trigonometry is fundamentally useful for this.
						Triangles are the strongest shapes

						### Computer Graphics
						To build games and animations you must first understand how to position staffs and to do this trig is very handy tool
						also if you what to simulate something in real life it helps a lot e.g pendulum, cars(in curve motion), solar system
						---
						### Medical imaging
						Trigonometry is used in medical imaging to create images of the human body. Medical technicians use trigonometry to calculatethe angles and positions of X-ray beams, and to create 3D images of internal organs
						<a href = "https://www.glassner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Trig-For-Computer-Graphics.pdf">check this pdf if you are intersted</a>
						---
						but besides this all and more applications it have trigonometry is very beautiful by it self
							for example the most beautiful mathematical identity is derived from Euler's formula which consists sin and cos
							also just enjoy this play by sin
